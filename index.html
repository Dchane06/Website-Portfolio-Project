          <h3>Basic Information</h3>
          <p>My first name is James, I don't really care if people call me by that name, but I usually go by Devan.<br>
          I actually really like my first name though as it's also my dad's, grandpa's, and great grandpa's and maybe so on!</p>

          <p>I'm 24 years old as of 2020.

          <p>I currently live in a small town called Bardstown, Kentucky.<br>
           A town that was named most beautiful small town in America. Known also for being the bourbon capital of the world.<br> <a href="https://www.cityofbardstown.org/">Learn more about Bardstown Here</a></p>

            <section>
              <h3>What got me interested in programming?</h3>
                <p>I got my first computer sometime around the age of 4 years old. For whatever reason, I was really interested in computers, my Dad was also big into computers at the time in the 90s.<br>
                 I didn't do too much on that computer, just played some games. But, my fascination with computers has grown since that day.<br>
                  Programming always seemed interesting to me, but I never thought I would be able to do it as it seemed very confusing. Recently however, I decided to look into programming a bit more.<br>
                   After taking some python courses, I found myself wanting to learn more and more. Thus, leading me to enrolling in Thinkful! I hope to continue to learn and one day fullfill my dream of having a career involving computers.<br>
                   I think it would be amazing to be able to work with a team on any kind of cool project/product, more minds mean better results!</p>
